We are considering the following three directions as potential areas for future research.

\begin{itemize}[label={$\bullet$}]
    \item \textbf{Testing with Datasets Containing Faulty Code} \\Investigate whether LLM-generated test cases can detect defects in flawed source code, rather than merely producing outputs that pass incorrect logic.
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    
    \item \textbf{Code Compression with Meta Large Language Model Compiler (LLM Compiler)} \\Use LLM Compiler to condense source code into a compact intermediate representation, achieving prompt compression and reducing tokens and API costs during LLM-based test case generation \cite{cummins2024metalargelanguagemodel}.
    \vspace{0.3cm}

    \item \textbf{Using Incorrect Docstrings} \\Examine whether and to what extent Docstrings contribute to the LLMâ€™s code comprehension, even when the documentation is inaccurate.
\end{itemize}
